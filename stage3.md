**Instructions**

Each question in the survey will contain a Neuroprint heatmap rendering thresholded at a w-score of 1.5 (essentially one and a half standard deviations). The maximum is 4. The color map is red-yellow (the range is displayed in the bottom left corner). The hemisphere orientation is left=left, as noted in the Stage 2 example. You will make your choice based on the patterns of degeneration represented by the heatmap.

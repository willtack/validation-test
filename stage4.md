**Instructions**

Each question in the survey will contain a Neuroprint heatmap rendering thresholded at a w-score of 1.5 (essentially one and a half standard deviations). The maximum is 4. The color map is JET256, which ranges from blue to red (the range is displayed in the bottom left corner). You will make your choice based on the patterns of degeneration represented by the heatmap **and the clinical context provided**.

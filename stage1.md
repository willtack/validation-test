**Instructions**

You will look at subjectsâ€™ T1 images using the links below and record your diagnostic choices in the [corresponding form](https://forms.gle/McRPQjKfjSLRB31XA).
I recommend opening the form in another window to facilitate flipping back and forth. I would also recommend using Chrome or Firefox if possible--Safari seems less reliable for these.
Image displays are in **neurological** orientation (left=left).

**Subjects**
